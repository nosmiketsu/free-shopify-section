    After spending years of research and development, Fort Knox and Burlington emerged as the epitome of our innovation.
    These products would eventually capture the essence of meticulously enclosed pool pumps with soundproofing
    capabilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our covers were specifically tailored to fulfill compliance guidelines for new pool installations. By focusing on
    this “pool pump only” requirement, we offered a precise solution that addressed the industry’s needs.
  </p>

  <p>Our journey, however, did not stop there.</p>

  <p>
    As a company deeply committed to sustainability and environmental responsibility, we sought ways to provide
    eco-friendly options for our valued clients. Thus, we introduced ECODefend and Chemical Storage Box as part of our
    diversified product line, which are both made from recycled plastic. Even at the end of their current use, these
    products can be melted and upcycled to a renewed purpose. We are proud to say that all our products are shipped in
    recyclable cardboard boxes, carefully packed with eco-friendly biofill.

  <p>
    Today, our pool pump covers earned the trust and satisfaction of countless customers across Australia (and now
    globally). Our goal of providing plenty of options for affordable and easy-to-install pool pump covers has been
    successfully achieved.
